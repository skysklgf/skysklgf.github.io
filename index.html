                             For many years, people have suffered from physical and economic damage due to the failure of their
                             machines. To identify the conditions of machines, they needed to open the machines and check what
                             is wrong. It is sometimes very difficult for some machines to be open and be checked. It is
                             not a convenient and efficient way if the structure of the machine is very complex, and the size of the
                             machine is huge. For the problem, General Electric (GE) company designed State-Based coloring to
                             visualize surge data from machines on the graph by plotting those data with different colors to
                             support the users.

                             A State-Based Plot Coloring system is a condition monitoring system which help users to easily understand a conditions of a machine by visualizing data from the machine. 
                             To visualize the conditions of the machine, plotting methods are used to let users identify what state their machine is in and why the machine failure happened. 
                             The software will virtually display data with different colors in a Trend Plot, a Cascade Plot, and a Bode Plot. 
                             When there is overlapping between those states, there will be a specific color on the overlap to notify users that there is a problem.

                             A State-Based Plot Coloring system is implemented in C# language for ease of development and the Window Presentation Foundation (WPF) is used for ease of development for several UIs. 
                             The system uses a database in order to store necessary information, such as Date, RPM, HZ, and Machine Name.
